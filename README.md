# Digital-DSM-Design-Notebook
## Description: 
This repository includes a Jupyter notebook utilizing python scientific and symbolic modules and custom widgets for a general digital delta-sigma modulator design calculator.  In addition, the notebook reads and processes basic block output series, as can be generated by a Verilog/VHDL simulation testbench, and compares it to the notebook design. 

The goal of this notebook development was for me to learn the python modules and jupyter/ipython techniques necessary for replicating the functionality of code/notebooks I have previously developed in Matlab and Mathematica.  In addition, my goal is to make the notebook as close as is practical to professional/presentation quality as well as being able to export plots/figures of equal quality.     

## Installation:
1. Update the custom modules file path in dsm_nb.ipynb.
2. Create symbolic links to the css and js files in the custom libraries to the local .ipython/nbextensions path.  The js and css files a are only present in the custom widget modules.

## Development Environment:
1. Python	2.7.11
2. matplotlib	1.5.1
3. IPython	4.1.1
4. sympy	0.7.6.1
5. numpy	1.10.4
6. ipywidgets	4.1.1
