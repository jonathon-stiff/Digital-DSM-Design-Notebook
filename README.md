# Digital-DSM-Design-Notebook
Abstract: This repository includes a Jupyter notebook utilizing python scientific and symbolic modules and custom widgets for a general digital delta-sigma modulator design calculator.  In addition, the notebook reads and processes basic block output, as would be generated by a Verilog/VHDL simulation testbench, and compares it to the notebook design. 

The goal of this notebook development was for me to learn the python modules and jupyter techniques necessary for replicating the functionality of code/notebooks I have previously developed in Matlab and Mathematica.  In addition, my goal is to make the notebook as close as is practical to professional/presentation quality as well as being able to export plots/figures of equal quality.
